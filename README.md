# Savings Circle
This is an example of a DApp that can be built with the Celo DApp Kit. 

A savings circle (sometimes called ROSCA in the US, or paluwagan in the Philippines) lets you pool funds with your friends to save for large purchases by paying into a pool regularly and alternating who receives the pool. For example, in a group of 12 members with a contribution of $100 per week, when it is a member's turn to receive the pool (every 12th week), they receive a lump sum of $1200. 

## Getting started
To get started, clone the repo and run `yarn` to install dependencies. Then run `yarn start` and follow the expo instructions to run the app. 

To use this DApp, you will also need the Celo Wallet. Get it from https://celo.org/build/wallet.
