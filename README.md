# Savings Circle
This is an example of a DApp that can be built with the Celo DApp Kit. Read more about DAppKit at [https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/dappkit/](https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/dappkit/)

A savings circle (sometimes called ROSCA in the US, or paluwagan in the Philippines) lets you pool funds with your friends to save for large purchases by paying into a pool regularly and alternating who receives the pool. For example, in a group of 12 members with a contribution of $100 per week, when it is a member's turn to receive the pool (every 12th week), they receive a lump sum of $1200.
